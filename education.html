                                        and explored his father's extensive library, where he developed a passion for
                                        literature, languages, and the arts.</p>

                                        This exposure to the harsh realities of colonial rule and feudalism deeply

                                        equality, and national identity. These ideals would later become central themes
                                        in his writings and advocacy for Philippine independence.</p>

                                        Philippine society and inspired by the teachings of his educators, Rizal began
                                        to form a deeper understanding of his country's plight under Spanish colonial
